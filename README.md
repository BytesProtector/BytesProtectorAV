Please Install python before using this and then use the Run_BytesProtector.bat file, this is a temporary solution to use the app until i manage to fix it, im working on a new release to fix this bug and its almost done please wait though, this update is also introducing more fixes for issues like freezing and crashing in the app and will also lower the detection rate on virustotal because of some lines i used as temporary lines like the eicar string introduced mass detections and so far i have it going from 10 to going to 2!.
